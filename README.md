Dear Reviewer,

Whatever you will find in this repository is partial and incomplete. My approach to coding is to do less but do it properly and with quality rather than do many things that are buggy and write code that I will be ashamed of if I come back to it later. I think in real work life, it's rarely necessary to set up a new project, get acquainted with a whole new API and project and implement three different features in a few hours. I did my best to show off my coding skills and hope what I have managed to do in this limited time will be enough to get some understanding of my programming skills and coding style.

Hope you will like it as I enjoyed working on this task :)
